## TODO:
- Figure out pullies and servos for ligaments, find tiny EEG sensors, figure out control system
- Find someone to help with legalties, especially when it comes to the open source community
- Write base firmware (+ API ?)
o- Idea: add connectors every few disk within the tail to make it fully modular, including the tip, and control system
- Figure out length, scale, materials, and design of all parts
- Create noise-signal ratio reduction and signal interpretation AI models for firmware
-  Find diameter and positioning of Co1 nerve endings for eeg (Alternatively set up eeg to autocalibrate on a per-person basis)
