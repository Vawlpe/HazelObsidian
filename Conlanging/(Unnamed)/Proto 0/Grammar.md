- The ==**Inferred**== class may be used for one-self or other direct parties in the conversation after initial introduction, or perhaps between people who know each other on better terms.
- Children only use ==**Inferred**== (only /**n**/) and ==**Abstract**== classes in daily speech due to their limited dialect before ==initiation into society as an "Adult"== who may speak the proper language, as ==classifying all nouns under these strict classes is unnecessary== when gaining a ==basic understanding of reality==.
