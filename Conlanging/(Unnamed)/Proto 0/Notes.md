# Notes
- Number system with a dual 6/9-base. See [[Numbers]]
- Additon subtraction system for grammatical number beynd the defined explicit affixes. Again, see [[Numbers]]. tl;dr `/ni/=a-b`, `/li/=a+b`, `/ti/=aรท2`, `/fi/=a*2`
- Find a way to evolve a dialect that, for cultural reasons, is the only language taught to children bellow a certain age I'm yet to decide on, but is similar enough that transitioning to the proper language isn't difficult...See [[Youth Dialect]] for details.
